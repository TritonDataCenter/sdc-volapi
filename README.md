# sdc-volapi

This repository is part of the Joyent SmartDataCenter project (SDC).  For
contribution guidelines, issues, and general documentation, visit the main
[SDC](http://github.com/joyent/sdc) project page.

The SDC Volumes API (VOLAPI) manages volumes for SDC. Volumes can be used to
store data that can be read and/or written by virtual machines (including Docker
containers, infrastructure containers and hardware virtual machines).

For a complete overview of volapi, please read the
[RFD 26](https://github.com/joyent/rfd/blob/master/rfd/0026/README.md) document.

# NFS Zone

When a volume is created, volapi will provision a SmartOS zone with a fabric NIC
attached. The zone will be marked with the following property:
```
  vm.internal_metadata['sdc:system_role'] = 'nfsvolumestorage';
```

The NFS volumes (zones) created by volapi come in two different versions.

## Version 1

Version 1 NFS volumes uses a Node.js server to handle the NFS connections.

Version 1 is deprecated and volapi will try to create version 2 volumes
when possible.

## Version 2

Version 2 NFS volumes use the SmartOS builtin NGZ (non global zone) NFS server.

Volumes (zones) created with version 2 will have the following internal_metadata
property set:

```
  vm.internal_metadata['volapi-nfs-version'] = 2;
```

Note that if a version 2 volume cannot be created (due to the requirement of a
newer platform version not being available), then volapi will fallback to
creating a version 1 NFS volume instead.

# Development

## Getting started

### Requirements

In order to be able to use Docker NFS shared volumes (Docker volumes created
with the `tritonnfs` driver), a [working sdc-docker installation is
required](https://github.com/joyent/sdc-docker#installation).

Without installing sdc-docker, it is still possible to use VOLAPI to create and
use volumes, just not through Docker APIs/clients.

### Installation

1. Install and enable the VOLAPI service by running the following command on
   your DC's headnode:

   ```
   $ sdcadm post-setup volapi
   ```

2. Enable NFS volumes feature flags by running the following commands on your
   DC's headnode:

   ```
   # Enables support for creating/managing NFS volumes with the docker API and
   # the docker volume commands
   $ sdcadm experimental nfs-volumes docker

   # Enables support for docker containers to automatically mount NFS volumes
   # at startup time
   $ sdcadm experimental nfs-volumes docker-automount

   # Enables support for creating/managing NFS volumes with CloudAPI
   $ sdcadm experimental nfs-volumes cloudapi

   # Enables support for non-Docker VMs (except KVM VMs) to automatically mount
   # NFS volumes at startup time
   $ sdcadm experimental nfs-volumes cloudapi-automount
   ```

3. Install the latest version of node-triton to get NFS shared volumes support:

   ```
   $ npm install -g triton
   ```
